# Decision making theory

## To run the app:
* Make sure Node.js and npm are installed on your computer.
* From the command line in the 'frontend/lab1/optimal-solution-front' folder, run the command 'npm install' to install all necessary dependencies.
* After installing the dependencies, build the project by running 'npm run build'.
* After launching the Spring Boot application, open a browser and go to the address 'http://localhost:8080' (or another port on which Spring Boot works by default).

1. For each line (1-3) according to the option ("Appendix A"), build a table of alternative values (A1-A20) in the area of criteria (Q1, Q2), where the values according to the first criterion correspond to the first digit of the number, according to the second criterion - the second digit of the number. Analytical (using the algorithms of paragraphs 3.1â€“3.2) and graphically determine the set of Pareto and Slater optimal solutions (6 figures).
2. For a line consisting of lines 1-3 ("Appendix A") by option, build a table of alternative values (A1-A60) in the area of criteria (Q1, Q2), where the values according to the first criterion correspond to the first digit of the number, according to the second criterion is the second digit of the number. Analytical (using the algorithms of clauses 3.1â€“3.2) and graphically determine the set of Pareto and Slater optimal solutions (2 figures).
